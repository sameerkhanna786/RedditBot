# Reddit Bot

This bot is just to experiment with API usage, developing bots for social media applications, and usage of non-standard ASCII characters.

## Getting Started

Complete setup of a reddit account. Prime your account by going to:
https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/

Setup an authorized application. Click script, give a valid url, and describe your bot in full detail.

After you have completed the setup process you will be navigated back to your dev page. Your client_id is the code under personal use script. Your secret code will be found in the box labeled secret.

Fill these in along with your account details in config.py

You are all set! Now just run run.py!


## Prerequisites and Installation

Nothing needed besides Python, the given files, and a fully setup Reddit account.
